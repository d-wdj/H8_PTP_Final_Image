    "Other than clustering, **dimensionality reduction** is one of unsupervised learning technique that aims to transform data, not group them together. The goal of all dimensionality reduction algorithm is **retain the informative parts of the data but with less of it**. For example, the answer for below question\n",

    "There are some ways to create a latent features. The most simple way is we can choose some features among others that tells us more information based on the context of dataset and case we deal with. But with this method, we will a lot of information becuase we simply drop and not use them."

    "Principal Component Analysis utilise a linear combination of observed features which form **principal components**. Principal components are linear combination of the original features in a dataset that aim to retain the most information in the original data. These principal components can be thought in the same way with latent features.\n",

    "- The created components are **orthogonal** to another. It means, when there are more components, the additional components will be orthogonal to one another. These orthogonal principal components will benefit since we don't have dependent features in our new dataset.\n",
